# OBB-Collision-Algorithm
2D OBB Collision Algorithm for VBA is a project that aims to implement the Oriented Bounding Box (OBB) collision detection algorithm specifically for 2D objects using VBA (Visual Basic for Applications), a programming language commonly used in Microsoft Office applications such as Excel, Word, and PowerPoint.

The 2D OBB Collision Algorithm for VBA project can be used in a variety of applications, such as creating interactive dashboards or games within Microsoft Excel or PowerPoint. It provides a simple and easy-to-use method for detecting collisions between 2D objects in real-time.
